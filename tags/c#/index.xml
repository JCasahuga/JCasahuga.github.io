      <description>The project This is a mobility research project, focusing on the development of a program that its able to create circuits of roads using straights, curves, roundabouts, intersections, traffic lightsâ€¦ and the ability to modify parameters like car flows, probability of exit in a roundabout, and traffic light timings, in order to find out the optimal combination to apply in the real case of traffic.
The question that came up to my head when thinking what project to do was if the roads in our cities were the most efficient that could be and if the roads could be improved somehow.</description>
